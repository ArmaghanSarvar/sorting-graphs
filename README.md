# sorting-graphs
My data structure final project ....
in this project adjacency list and adjacency matrix are implemented for the graph which is read from the text files and then it's sorted with quick sort, merge sort, bubble sort, insertion sort in order to compare the speed(time) and memory that each of the sorting algorithms and the two different graph storing data structures take.
